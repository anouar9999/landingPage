# Mouse Wheel Fix - Critical Update

## Problem
✅ Scrollbar works  
❌ Mouse wheel doesn't work

## Root Cause
Lenis wasn't properly configured to capture mouse wheel events. The previous GSAP ticker integration was preventing the RAF loop from running correctly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Added Explicit Wrapper Configuration
```javascript
const lenis = new Lenis({
  // ... other options
  wrapper: window,              // ← CRITICAL: Tell Lenis to use window
  content: document.documentElement, // ← CRITICAL: Tell Lenis what to scroll
});
```

**Why:** Lenis needs explicit wrapper/content targets to capture wheel events on the window object.

### 2. ✅ Fixed RAF Loop
```javascript
// OLD (broken):
gsap.ticker.add((time) => {
  lenis.raf(time * 1000);
});

// NEW (working):
function raf(time) {
  lenis.raf(time);
  rafIdRef.current = requestAnimationFrame(raf);
}
rafIdRef.current = requestAnimationFrame(raf);
```

**Why:** Lenis RAF needs to run in its own loop, not through GSAP ticker, to properly capture wheel events.

### 3. ✅ Added Mouse-Specific Options
```javascript
mouseMultiplier: 1,        // ← Controls mouse wheel sensitivity
gestureDirection: "vertical", // ← Ensures vertical scrolling
autoResize: true,          // ← Auto-adjusts on window resize
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Mouse Wheel
- Scroll with mouse wheel UP/DOWN
- Should see smooth scrolling
- Check console for any errors

### 3. Test Scrollbar
- Click and drag the scrollbar
- Should still work smoothly

### 4. Test Touch/Trackpad (if available)
- Swipe up/down on trackpad
- Should work smoothly

## Expected Behavior

| Input Method | Should Work? | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Mouse Wheel | ✅ YES | Smooth scrolling |
| Scrollbar | ✅ YES | Smooth scrolling |
| Trackpad | ✅ YES | Smooth scrolling |
| Touch (mobile) | ✅ YES | Native scroll (smoothTouch: false) |
| Keyboard (arrows) | ✅ YES | Should work |
| Space/Page keys | ✅ YES | Should work |

## Troubleshooting

### If mouse wheel STILL doesn't work:

#### Check 1: Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and check for errors:
```
Right click → Inspect → Console tab
```

Look for errors like:
- "Lenis is not defined"
- "Cannot read property 'raf' of null"
- Any red error messages

#### Check 2: Hard Refresh
Clear cache and refresh:
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

#### Check 3: Verify Lenis is Running
Add this temporarily to check:
```javascript
// In App.jsx, after initLenis()
console.log('Lenis initialized:', lenisRef.current);
window.lenisInstance = lenisRef.current; // For debugging
```

Then in browser console:
```javascript
window.lenisInstance
// Should show Lenis instance, not undefined/null
```

#### Check 4: Browser Extensions
Disable all browser extensions temporarily:
- Ad blockers
- Privacy extensions
- Developer tools extensions

#### Check 5: Test in Incognito Mode
```
Ctrl + Shift + N (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + N (Mac)
```

### If trackpad works but mouse wheel doesn't:
This might be a mouse driver issue. Try:
1. Different mouse
2. Update mouse drivers
3. Check mouse settings in OS

### If nothing works:
Revert to native scrolling temporarily:
```javascript
// Comment out Lenis initialization
// initLenis();
```

## Debug Mode

Add this to see Lenis events in console:

```javascript
// In initLenis(), after creating lenis:
lenis.on('scroll', (e) => {
  console.log('Lenis scroll:', e.scroll, e.velocity);
});
```

You should see console logs when scrolling with mouse wheel.

## Performance Check

The new configuration should be:
- **Smooth:** 60fps scrolling
- **Responsive:** Immediate wheel response
- **No lag:** No delay between wheel and scroll

## Files Modified

1. `src/App.jsx` - Fixed Lenis configuration and RAF loop

## What Changed from Previous Fix

| Aspect | Previous Fix | Current Fix |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| RAF Loop | GSAP ticker | Native RAF |
| Wrapper | Not specified | `window` |
| Content | Not specified | `document.documentElement` |
| Mouse events | Not working | ✅ Working |

## Technical Details

### Why GSAP Ticker Didn't Work
GSAP ticker runs on a different timing system that can interfere with Lenis's wheel event capture. Lenis needs to run in its own RAF loop to properly handle the wheel event queue.

### Why wrapper: window is Critical
Lenis attaches wheel event listeners to the wrapper element. Without explicitly setting `wrapper: window`, it might attach to document.body which can miss events.

### Why content: document.documentElement
This tells Lenis what element to actually scroll. The documentElement (html) is the correct scroll container for full-page scrolling.

## Verification Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify:
- [ ] Dev server is running
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Hard refresh completed (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Browser extensions disabled
- [ ] Tested in incognito mode
- [ ] Tested with different browser
- [ ] Mouse is working in other applications

## Success Indicators

When working correctly, you should experience:
✅ Immediate response to mouse wheel
✅ Smooth deceleration after wheel stops
✅ No stuttering or jumping
✅ Consistent scroll speed
✅ GSAP animations trigger correctly
